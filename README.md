# ScreenGrab
Simple Screen Grabbing Software for creating Time Lapse Videos or tutorials. 
Screan Grab is a very simple screen grabbing software written in c#
At present it doesn't support full resolution capture, but this is a feature that I am looking to write in the future,
This program was originally made as a simply app for a friend, hence the degree of "aggressive" error messages. If you 
intend to use it for professional use, I would recommend first going through and removing the messages which refer
to the user as idiots. 

Thank you for you intrest.
